# Volkan Sonmez's Coding Projects 

© 2021 - current, Volkan Sonmez, www.pythonicfool.com

This is a repository of teaching materials, code, and data for my data analysis and machine learning projects.

Each repository will (usually) correspond to one of the posts on my [web site](http://www.pythonicfool.com/).

Be sure to check the documentation (usually in IPython Notebook format) in the directory you're interested in for the notes on the analysis, data usage terms, etc.

The licensor cannot revoke these freedoms as long as you follow the license terms.

Under the following terms:

* **Attribution**—You must give appropriate credit (mentioning that your work is derived from work that is © Volkan Sonmez and, where practical, linking to http://www.pythonicfool.com/), and indicate if changes were made. You may do so in any reasonable manner, but not in any way that suggests the licensor endorses you or your use.

**No additional restrictions**—You may not apply legal terms or technological measures that legally restrict others from doing anything the license permits.
